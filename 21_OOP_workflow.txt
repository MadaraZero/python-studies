OOP Workflow
================== ===========-

1. Write or draw about the problem.
2. Extract key concepts from #1 and research them.
3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
5. Repeat and refine.

Example of application:
  1. Contemplation
I want to create a program that organizes information about pets from individuals.
Information such as name of the pet, species of the pet, domain of pet, and the
age of the pet.

  2. Extract key concepts
- classes
- has-a class
  * name
  * species
  * domain
  * age
  * owner
  * ID
- is-a Pet class
  * is-a pet
-reproducing the information.
* raw_input
* in put of ID to extract pet information

  3. Create some Object Mapping
  - Pet class

  4. Code

  class Pet(object):
    def __init__(self, owner, petname, species, age, pid)
    self.owner = owner
    self.petname = petname
    self.species = species
    self.age = age
    self.pid = pid

    def __str__(self):
    return "Pet Name: %s\nSpecies: %s\nAge: %s\nOwnner: %s\nPet ID: %s\n" %
    (self.petname, self.species, self.age, self.owner, self.pid)

  5. Rinse and repeat
